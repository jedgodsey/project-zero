# Project #0: The Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun—**a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** – since you've already gotten your feet wet with a few small apps, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!


---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* **HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.**
* **Git 20+ commits** Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
* **Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README** 
* **Wireframe:** - Basically draw out what your game will look like—very different way it could look. You can use paper or any wireframe tool you find online.
* **User Stories** - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
    1.  The user click starts and the level starts
    2.  When the user hits the ```f key``` a fire ball is catuplulated at a target. 
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **JavaScript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (we will show you how)
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* Be reasonably complex

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A working MVP (minium viable product) what is the absolute bare minimum functionality for you game, do not make it more complex until you've completed your MVP.
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* **A ``README.md`` file** with an explanation of what the project is and why you made it, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable).  In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme. 
* A 10 minute presentation to your classmates and instructor, illustrating:
    * App functionality
    * Triumphs
    * Challenges
    * Words of Wisdom
    * Code snippets

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** _(a great reference for all things  Javascript)_
* **[jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com)** _(if you're using jQuery)_
* **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_
* **[Example Readme Files](https://git.generalassemb.ly/r-sei-12/Project_Planning_Examples)** _(a great reference for planning materials)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories and wireframes as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, great job!_

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, element inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* During the day, work through problems in class & **ask questions when you need to!** We're here to help prevent you from burning through your time with wild goose chases. Add relevant code to your game each night too, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. There should be _at least_ a couple dozen commits. 
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Plan to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
